# Intention
This guide is for poeople interested in using GitHub. I have briefly outlined how I personally use GitHub - there are other ways of using it and many ways of connecting it to other applications, but I believe my way is relatively straightforward and captures some of the main features of GitHub.

# What is GitHub
GitHub has 3 main uses:
1. Code/File backup
Store a copy of your files on GitHub's servers
1. Version Control
If multiple people are working on a project, GitHub offers some nice features to track who is doing what.
1. File Rendering
GitHub knows how to nicely display certain filetypes that make simply viewing certain files much easier (this very Markdown document for example)

# How to use GitHub
1. Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
1. Create a Repository on GitHub
This is essentially a folder where you can store files.
1. Install GitHub Desktop (see [Installing GitHub Desktop](#installing-github-desktop))
1. Clone your Repository with GitHub Desktop
This creates a local (on your hard drive) copy of your Repository
1. Edit and run your code locally as normal
1. When you want to upload your code
* Save your work locally  
* Open GitHub Desktop  
* Navigate to your Repository  
Your changes should be displayed here. Green shows additions, red shows deletions. Should look something like this  

![Alt text](images/GitHub_Desktop_commit.png)

* Write a summary of your changes
* Hit "Commit to main"
* Hit "Push Origin"
This 'pushes' your local files onto GitHub's servers, replacing your old files in that Repository.

## Viewing Your Repository
You can go to the GitHub site, login, navigate to your Repository, and see all your code/files there from any web browser. This is a great way to share content!

# Installing GitHub Desktop
Follow the instructions on the [GitHub Desktop site](https://desktop.github.com/)
