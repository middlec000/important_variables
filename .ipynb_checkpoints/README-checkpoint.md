# Project Goals
Primary Goal:
* Provide a tool to determine the predictor variables most related to a certain outcome variable.  
Secondary Goals:
* Provide users the opportunity to learn some useful statistics.  
* Provide users the opportunity to learn some useful coding skills.  

# How this Works
The program I provide here is written in the Python language in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. To use it you must have an editor that can read Jupyter Notebooks. I recommend following my instructions on how to install Anaconda and JupyterLab at this [link](guides/workspace_setup.md).  

To use my program you must go to the "programs" folder, download the appropriate program, then open it using JupyterLab or some other editor that can read Jupyter Notebook files.

# Resources
In the "guides" folder I have provided several helpful guides on setting up and using the recommended tools.
